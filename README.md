# Windows-Quick-Security-Analyser

The objective of this mini-project is to develop a tool to perform various security checks, such as malware protection, user account auditing, VPN and proxy configurations, among others. Using a graphical user interface (GUI), the user can select the desired parameters for the check, and at the end of the process, the results are generated in JSON format. This JSON can be exported to more accessible formats, such as Excel or PDF, for more detailed analysis.
